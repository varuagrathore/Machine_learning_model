Approach:
=========
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Loaded the train and test datasets.
   - Converted 'Timestamp' to datetime format.
   - Cleaned 'VAT' and 'Barrel_Price' columns by converting them to numeric types.
   - Handled missing values by filling them with mean values.
   
2. Feature Engineering:
   - Extracted year, month, day, and hour from 'Timestamp' for both train and test datasets.
   - Dropped the original 'Timestamp' column after extraction.

3. Model Training:
   - Used RandomForestRegressor for training the model.
   - Split the training data into training and validation sets (80% - 20% split).
   - Trained the model on the training set and evaluated it on the validation set.

4. Prediction and Submission:
   - Predicted prices for the test set.
   - Created a submission file with the required format ('Timestamp' and 'Price').

Tools Used:
===========
- Python
- pandas for data manipulation
- scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
