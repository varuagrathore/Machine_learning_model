# 📧 Spam Classifier

This project implements a spam classifier using Python. The classifier processes and analyzes emails to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails. It utilizes various Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup, email, and scikit-learn to preprocess the data and perform the classification.

## 🔧 Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- BeautifulSoup4
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- urlextract
- nltk

## 📂 Project Structure

- `spam_classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the spam classifier code.
- `datasets/`: Directory where the spam and ham datasets will be stored.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## 📥 Fetching Data

The project uses the SpamAssassin public corpus for spam and ham datasets. The data is downloaded and extracted to the `datasets` directory. This step ensures that the required data is available for processing.

## 📜 Loading Emails

Emails are loaded from the extracted directories using the `email` module. This module parses the email files, enabling further processing and analysis.

## 🔍 Email Processing

The structure of the emails is analyzed to identify common patterns. This step helps in understanding the composition of emails, which is crucial for effective classification.

## 🔄 Email to Text Conversion

Emails, especially those in HTML format, are converted to plain text using BeautifulSoup. This step ensures that the content of the emails is in a uniform format suitable for text processing.

## 📝 Feature Extraction

The `EmailToWordCounterTransformer` class processes the email text and extracts features for the classifier. This step involves text normalization, such as converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and stemming words.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Run the `spam_classifier.ipynb` notebook to fetch the data and preprocess it.
3. Use the `EmailToWordCounterTransformer` class to transform the emails into features.
4. Integrate these features into a machine learning model for spam classification.

## 🎉 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a spam classifier using Python. By following the steps outlined in the notebook, you can preprocess email data, extract meaningful features, and train a classifier to distinguish between spam and ham emails.
